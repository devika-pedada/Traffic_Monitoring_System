# Traffic_Monitoring_System
This project is a traffic monitoring system that detects and counts vehicles on both sides of the road and measures their speed. The entire project is designed using image processing techniques in Python with the help of certain libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV.

## Features
- Detect and count vehicles on both sides of the road
- Estimates vehicle speed (Needs more improvement) 
- Collected data to generate reports on traffic volume, speed, and patterns
- Easy to set up and use with Python

## Usage
- The system uses a video input, which can be changed to use your own video file or camera input (but make sure to change the roi according to your own input)
- Once the system is running, it will detect and count vehicles and measure their speed

## Contributing
- If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request
- All contributions are welcome, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements to the documentation
